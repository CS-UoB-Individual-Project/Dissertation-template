# Dissertation-template

This is a template for the [Individual
Projects](https://cs-uob-individual-project.github.io/) Dissertation at the
University of Bristol.

You can find more information in DissertationTemplate.tex, but this includes
sections that we would expect within a typical CS dissertation.

Note that there are some compulsory sections that we expect to see within the
final submitted version, check these carefully and ask your supervisor if you
are unsure.


If you have any questions, email [Mike Wray](mailto:michael.wray@bristol.ac.uk)
or [Sarah Connolly](mailto:sarah.connolly@bristol.ac.uk)
